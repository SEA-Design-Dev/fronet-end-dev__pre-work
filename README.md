# Welcome!

Welcome to the Code Fellows SEA-D44 Front End Development Accelerator course. The following document will outline the primary expectations that we have for all students to be prepared with on __DAY ONE__ of the class. 

## A working computer

This is a course that will focus 100% around building software. So in order to accomplish this task, we need to ensure that you show up to class with a fully working and highly operational laptop computer. It can be a Mac, Unix or Windows box, we are not concerned about that too much. 

Keep in mind that the vast majority of lectures will be showing examples of code using a Mac on OS X. Their may be configuration differences between Unix or Windows that you will have to address. During lectures we will do our best to provide alternate platform solutions, but there will be limited time for platform troubleshooting. 

We do ask that whatever computer you show up with, you know how to use it well. This is not a computer 101 class and we will be speeding through topics quickly. If you are unable to complete class work because of your inability to configure your computer, that will be an issue that we need to resolve quickly. 

### On Mac ... install Xcode

If you are using a Mac, make sure that you have Xcode installed. Basically you need a C level code compiler to install a lot of the magical goodies we will use in class. 

You should be able to install this via Apple's App Store or [download](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) from here. 

### Welcome to Node.js

There are tools that we will be using that have a dependency on Node.js, so it's a good idea to make sure that it's installed and operational on your computer by day one as well. 




## Get to know the CLI

Another tool that we will become very familiar with over the course is the Command Line Interface or __CLI__. Some great reading to get you rolling if you are not yet familiar with using the Terminal.app on OS X are;

* [Live in the Terminal](http://www.anotheruiguy.com/ux-design-dev/_book/learning-computers/life-in-the-terminal.html)
* [CLI you should know](http://www.anotheruiguy.com/ux-design-dev/_book/learning-computers/cli-to-know.html)
* [Terminal cheat sheet](http://www.anotheruiguy.com/ux-design-dev/_book/learning-computers/terminal-cheatsheet.html)
* [Set up Bash and crate handy shortcuts](http://www.anotheruiguy.com/ux-design-dev/_book/learning-computers/set-up-bash-alias.html)

While Terminal.app is good, [iTerm2](http://iterm2.com/) is better! Download and profit! 


## Git basics

Learning Git is a career long learning curve, but we have expectations coming into the class that you will have some basics already addressed and configured;

1. You __MUST__ have a Github account
1. Have Git installed
1. Have either attended, or tested out of, the [Git workshop](https://www.codefellows.org/class-calendar#sea-w32) and have downloaded/read [Git for everyone](https://www.gitbook.com/book/anotheruiguy/gitforeveryone/details)
1. Have Git bascis understood;
	* can `git init` a repo
	* understands what a `branch` is
	* when asked to fork a repo, you don't reply with `o_O`
	* merging is not only a traffic concept 
	
### Setup Git

If you do not yet have a Github account and need to sync Github with your laptop, please be sure to read over this section on [setting up Github](http://www.anotheruiguy.com/ux-design-dev/_book/git/github.html).

### Managing Pull Requests

Another process that we will make heavy use of is __Git Pull Requests__. If you are not familiar with this, please be sure to read/review [Using pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). This is a rather involved process and there are nuances that need to be discussed, so consider this an introduction of sorts and we will cover more of this in class. 
	
## Text editors

For the vast majority of the course, we will not be using WYSIWYG editors or any type of GUI application to write code or access repositories. If you have a text editor that you prefer, you are welcome to use it. 

By far, the preferred text editor of Code Fellows is [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/). It's very easy to configure and is highly customizable. There is no need to buy a license at this time, there is a very generous trial period. 

For more information on using Sublime Text, please [this section on Working w/Sublime](http://www.anotheruiguy.com/ux-design-dev/_book/sublime/README.html)

You should also read this section on [Link your Terminal.app to Sublime text](http://www.anotheruiguy.com/ux-design-dev/_book/learning-computers/link-terminal-to-sublime.html) for quick and easy open access from the CLI to Sublime Text.
